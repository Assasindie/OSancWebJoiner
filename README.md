Click on an active raid -> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24616302/127109902-98681a28-a84b-49eb-9966-c3f9a0112c91.png)
find this request and copy the access_token from there.

## Raid ID

Find the last raid number (in url of last raid) and increment by 1

## Joining
Wait ~10 seconds after the discord says a new raid is opening soon then press the join button, if some message appears below about internal error or too many requests you started it too early. You can probably do it as you see the raid open on the webapp as this will program eliminate loading times.

## Warning
You may get suspended/banned from OSanc for using this - not my problem use at your own risk. More people that use the less likely you will get good reacts like inc. This program will probably stop working if they change how to join raids, will fix if I can be bothered (or you can make a PR and fix urself :))
